**Introduction:** This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides a wide range of health related attributes. It has 10 columns described as below:
1. **ID:** A unique identifier for each individual data entry.
2. **Pregnancies:** Number of times an individual has been pregnant.
3. **Glucose:** Blood sugar levels measured over a span of 2 hours during an oral glucose tolerance test.
4. **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure readings in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg).
5. **SkinThickness:** Thickness of the skinfold at the triceps, measured in millimeters (mm).
6. **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin level, measured in milli-international units per milliliter (mu U/ml). 
7. **BMI:** Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/mÂ²).
8. **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function refers to a numerical score of diabetes risk based on family history.
9. **Age:** Age of the individual at the time of data collection in years.
10. **Outcome:** Binary classification indicating the individual has diabetes (1) or does not have diabetes (0).
